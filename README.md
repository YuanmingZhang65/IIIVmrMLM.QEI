# IIIVmrMLM.QEI

3VmrMLM-MEJA for trait phenotypes are used to identify QTNs and QEIs, while 3VmrMLM-random and 3VmrMLM-fixed for indirect indicators are used to idnetify QEIs.

If users want to identify QTN-by-environment interactions (QEIs), please use the IIIVmrMLM.QEI software. In this software, multi-environment joint analysis may be used to directly identify QTNs and QEIs (this function is also included in the IIIVmrMLM software), while single-environment analyses under random/fixed SNP-effect models, along with trait differences, regression intercept and coefficient, regression coefficient of trait phenotypes on environmental factor (such as temperature), and environmental variation indicators (range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation) as phenotypes, are used to indirectly identify QEIs. The software is released on 2022-11-25, and updated on 2023-04-03.
