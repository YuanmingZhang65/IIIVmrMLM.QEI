# IIIVmrMLM.QEI

3VmrMLM-MEJA in the IIIVmrMLM software is used to associate trait phenotypes in multi-environments with marker genotypes for directly identifying QTNs and QEIs, while 3VmrMLM-random and 3VmrMLM-fixed (single data analysis) in current software is used to associate indirect indicators with marker genotypes for indirectly idnetifying QEIs.

The indirect indicators include trait differences, regression intercept and slope (coefficient) of trait phenotypes on environmental index, regression intercept and slope of trait phenotypes on environmental factor (such as meteorological factors, i.e., temperature, treatmental levels, soil fertilizer content, and other environmental conditions), and environmental variation indicators (range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation) as phenotypes.

The software is released on 2022-11-25, 2023-04-03, and 2024-01-29, and updated on 2024-11-24. In this software, windows and command line (linux) versions are compressed into the software file.
