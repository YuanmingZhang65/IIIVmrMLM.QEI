# IIIVmrMLM.QEI

If users want to identify QTN-by-environment interactions (QEIs), please use the IIIVmrMLM.QEI software. In this software, multi-environment joint analysis may be used to directly identify QTNs and QEIs (this function is also included in the IIIVmrMLM software), while single-environment analyses under random/fixed SNP-effect models, along with trait differences, regression intercept and coefficient, and environmental variation indicators (range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation) as phenotypes, are used to indirectly identify QEIs. The software is released on 2022-11-25.
