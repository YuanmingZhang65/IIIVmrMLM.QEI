# IIIVmrMLM.QEI

3VmrMLM-MEJA is used to associate trait phenotypes in multi-environments with marker genotypes for directly identifying QTNs and QEIs, this function is also included in the IIIVmrMLM software, while 3VmrMLM-random and 3VmrMLM-fixed (single data analysis) is used to associate indirect indicators (four environment variation indicators, regression intercept and regression slope, meteorological factors, treatmental levels, soil fertilizer content, and other environmental conditions) for indirectly idnetifying QEIs.

The indirect indicators include trait differences, regression intercept and slope (coefficient), regression slope of trait phenotypes on environmental factor (such as temperature), and environmental variation indicators (range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation) as phenotypes. The software is released on 2022-11-25, 2023-04-03, and 2024-01-29, and updated on 2024-08-17.
